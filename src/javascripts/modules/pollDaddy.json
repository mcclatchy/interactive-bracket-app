      "For more than 30 years, diners of all nationalities have lined up outside Tropical Chinese on weekends for their fresh, hot dim sum carts, weaving around a bustling dining room with endless choices of hot, shareable plates, including siu mai dumplings, Chinese buns, Peking duck, five-spice fried chicken and orange beef.",
    "team2":
      "Former Venezuelan nightclub owners know how to put on a show at Bocas House, with dinosaur-sized tomahawk steaks (all grass fed and hormone free) and Instagram-worthy milkshakes that come rimmed with things like Nutella and stacked with entire brownies or personal-sized Key lime pies."
